        <p>Chiang Kai-shek was born in China. He decided to build his nation with wealthy individuals and brought all the gold from China. This made China furious as gold was its source of wealth, and he took it all. He created everything, from the government to ministries, and decided to created a non-communist nation. He also declared himself the first president of Taiwan.</p>

        <p>After the president, Chiang Kai-Shek, took his last breath in 1975, a memorial hall was built in his name to honor him as the first president of Taiwan. It was opened to the public five years later, in 1980. The hall faces west, with four sides of white concrete and a blue octagonal roof, symbolizing good fortune in Chinese culture. It also includes two stairways with 89 steps each, symbolizing the years he lived.</p>
